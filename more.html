								<h2>Our Story</h2>
								<p>Our group was founded by the visionary MisfortuneVR, with the invaluable support of co-founder Kruzl. What started as a small community of like-minded players quickly turned into something much more. Within just two weeks of being created, our ranks swelled to over 100 members, all driven by a shared passion for excellence and pushing the limits in Orion Drift. This rapid growth is a testament to the strength of our community and the skill level of our players, who all contribute to making our group one of the most formidable forces in the game.</p>
								<p>From the beginning, we set out to create a space where only the best of the best could come together, and our success in attracting top-tier players speaks to that vision. Today, we are a dynamic and thriving group, not just focused on events but also on creating lasting friendships, strategizing for the toughest challenges, and constantly evolving our gameplay to stay ahead of the competition. Whether it’s through our Driftball games, parkour challenges, or large-scale raids, our dedication to excellence is at the core of everything we do.</p>
